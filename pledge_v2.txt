### PLEDGE (2019) ###



3.5 MANIFESTO

The planet is on the brink of a climate collapse, our future is endangered, the foundations of life and health are being destroyed. We need politicians to take action against the destruction of our planet, the very foundation of life. We need mobilized citizens and strong movements that can bring about change.

The 3.5 Manifesto has been created so that a sufficient proportion of the global population save our future from the oncoming climate collapse.

The 3.5 manifesto is inspired by the insights of political scientist Erica Chenoweth. Chenoweth has proven that a non-violent political movement will acheive its goal if it has the active and sustained participation of just 3.5% of the total population.

Let's act now, before it's too late.




In agreement with the 3.5 manifesto I, Alexander Fred-Ojala ( https://keybase.io/afo ), pledge to:


1. Donate 3.5% of my income after taxes to environmental organizations striving for political change (e.g. awareness, mobilization, regulations, a global carbon tax).

2. Dedicate 3.5% of my waking hours (approx 4hrs / week) to environmental and humanitarian non-profit work.

3. Spread the word of the 3.5 manifesto and incentivize friends, family members, and others to commit to a PLEDGE. The goal is to mobilize 3.5% of the population in Stockholm (35k), Sweden (350k), Europe (25.25Mn), and globally (257Mn). 



3.5: As part of my pledge I have chosen to

- become an active climate activist (by joining Extinction Rebellion)
- educate myself on topics of sustainability, activism, political processes, the science of climate change, carbon-reduction technologies etc
- eat a vegan diet (only 3.5% of my meals can be non-vegan, approx 1 meal / week)
- switch to an electricity company that produces 100% renewable energy
- not take any personal flights and climate compensate for all business flights
- limit my use of disposable plastic articles



PLEDGE COMMITTED JULY 4TH 2019.
