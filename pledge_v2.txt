3.5 MANIFESTO

The planet is on the brink of a climate collapse, our future is endangered, the foundations of life and health are being destroyed. We need politicians to take action against the destruction of our planet, the very foundation of life. We need mobilized citizens and strong movements that can bring about change.

The 3.5 Manifesto has been created so that a sufficient proportion of the global population save our future from the oncoming climate collapse.

The 3.5 manifesto is inspired by the civil resistance research conducted by the political scientist Erica Chenoweth. Chenoweth has analytically proven that "no non-violent political campaigns failed once they had achieved the active and sustained participation of just 3.5% of the total population". 

Let's act, before it's too late.




In agreement with the 3.5 manifesto I, Alexander Fred-Ojala ( https://keybase.io/afo ), pledge to:


1. Donate 3.5% of my income after taxes to environmental organizations striving for political change (e.g. awareness, mobilization, regulations, global carbon tax)

2. Dedicate 3.5% of my waking hours (approx 4hrs / week) to environmental and humanitarian non-profit work.

3. Only eat non-vegan meals 3.5% of the time (approx 1 meal / week)

3.5 Spread the word of the 3.5 manifesto and incentivize friends, family, and others to commit to a PLEDGE. The goal is to mobilize 3.5% of the people in Stockholm (35k), Sweden (350k), Europe (25.25Mn), and globally (257Mn). 



As part of my pledge I have also chosen to:

- Limit my use of disposable plastic articles.
- Switch to an electricity company that produces 100% renewable energy.
- Not take any personal flights and climate compensate for all business flights.
- Educate myself on topics of sustainability, activism, political processes, the science of climate change, carbon-reduction technology etc.
- Become an active climate activist (by joining Extinction Rebellion)



PLEDGE COMMITTED JULY 4TH 2019.
