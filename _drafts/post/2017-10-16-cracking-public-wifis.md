#### Are you sick of paying for Wifi at airports, cafes, shopping malls, in nature?

Well, I wanted to share a trick I've used for two years.

Find an open network that provides complimentary internet (e.g. limited trial for 30 mins, two hours). This is very common in airports, cafes, by public squares etc.

Connect to the network, use up your quota, and then just change your computer's MAC address to be granted another period of *free* internet.

You can easily change the MAC Address with the OSX app [LinkLair](https://halo.github.io/LinkLiar/installation.html) or by changing it [manually](https://www.howtogeek.com/192173/how-and-why-to-change-your-mac-address-on-windows-linux-and-mac/).

**Note:** The MAC address is your computers unique identifier. By spoofing it you're basically acting / identified as another device. This is not going to affect how your computer works and it's even good from a privacy perspective.
